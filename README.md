We present PR2, a humanoid robot testbed that evaluates a humanoid robot testbed designed for entry-level students with supports in

* **<span style="color: #EC407A;">bipedal locomotion</span>**  

* **<span style="color: #03A9F4;">multi-modal manipulation</span>** 

* **<span style="color: #FF7043;">interaction with vision and language foundation models</span>**
 
<b>PR2</b>, a physics-realistic and photo-realistic humanoid robot testbed, 
is designed to facilitate the collaboration between Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) and humanoid robotics. 
PR2 offers high-quality scene rendering and dynamic robot simulation, enabling (i) The creation of diverse scenes 
with various digital assets, (ii) the integration of advanced perception or foundation models, and (iii) the implementation 
of planning and control algorithms for dynamic humanoid robot behaviors based on environmental feedback. 


This testbed opens new avenues for research into task-oriented humanoid perception and locomotion. 
The beta version of PR2 has been deployed for the simulation track of <span style="color: #EC407A; font-weight: bold"> a nationwide full-size humanoid robot competition for college students, 
attracting 137 teams and over 400 participants within four months </span> . This competition covered traditional tasks in bipedal walking, 
as well as novel challenges in loco-manipulation and language-instruction-based object search, marking a first for public college robotics competitions. A retrospective analysis suggests that future competitions should emphasize the integration of locomotion with manipulation and perception. 
By making the PR2 testbed publicly available at <a href="https://pr2-humanoid.github.io/"><b>PR2</b> website</a>, we aim to further advance education and training in humanoid robotics.
